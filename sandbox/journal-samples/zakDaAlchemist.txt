i enter the hallway without hesitation
a finite number of rodents scurry

the path is dimly lit
and the carpet maintains a familiar musk
beckoning me to take the plunge

my lungs compress as i ambulate into the unknown
my footsteps crashing into the silence
like waves on a cool ocean night

a cross on the table, a blueish complexion
torn, soulless
the shadow fades

may time come upon us
gone with the universe
i pray: a minute, a second

there is no anything
there is no nothing
there is only the crucible
